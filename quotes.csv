Tywin Lannister,Any man who must say "I am the king" is no true king.

Tyrion Lannister,[to Joffrey]/We've had vicious kings and we've had idiot kings| but I don't know if we've ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king!
Tyrion Lannister,Let me give you some advice| bastard. Never forget what you are| the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor and it can never be used to hurt you.
Robb Stark,All men should keep their word| kings most of all.
Eddard Stark,You think my life is some precious thing to me? That I would trade my honor for a few more years... of what? You grew up with actors. You learned their craft and you learnt it well. But I grew up with soldiers. I learned to die a long time ago.
Brienne of Tarth,Nothing's more hateful than failing to protect the one you love.

Ramsay Snow,My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples... but my father taught me: aim for their head!
Ramsay Snow,To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow. You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall. You have betrayed your own kind. You have betrayed the North. Winterfell is mine| bastard. Come and see. Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon. His direwolf's skin is on my floor. Come and see. I want my bride back. Send her to me| bastard| and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers. Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man| woman| and babe living under your protection. You will watch as I skin them living. You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister. You will watch as my dogs devour your wild little brother. Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest. Come and see. -Ramsay Bolton| Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North
Tywin Lannister,A lion does not concern himself with the opinion of sheep.
Ramsay Snow,If you think this has a happy ending| you haven't been paying attention.
Jon Snow,I heard it was best to keep your enemies close.

Stannis Baratheon,We march to victory| or we march to defeat. But we go forward. Only forward.
Robert Baratheon,I'm simply asking you to run my kingdom while I eat| drink| and whore myself into an early grave.
Oberyn Martell,When we met your sister| she promised she would show you to us. Every day we would ask. Every day she would say| "Soon." Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and... she unveiled the freak. Your head was a bit large. Your arms and legs were a bit small| but no claw. No red eye. No tail between your legs. Just a tiny pink cock. We didn't try to hide our disappointment. "That's not a monster|" I told Cersei| "that's just a baby." And she said| "He killed my mother." And she pinched your little cock so hard| I thought she might pull it off. Until your brother made her stop. "It doesn't matter|" she told us. "Everyone says he will die soon| I hope they are right; he should not have lived this long."
Joffrey Baratheon,If I tell the Hound to cut you in half| he'll do it without a second thought.
Jaime Lannister,[about Ned Stark]/By what right does the wolf judge the lion? By what right?
Jaime Lannister,[to Brienne| about Aerys Targaryen]/Tell me| if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men| women and children burnt alive| would you have done it? Would you have kept your oath then?
Robert Baratheon,The whore is pregnant!
