# Web-Scraping
Data Extraction from the website using BeautufulSoup
In this project, I have extracted the famous quotes quoted by characters in some acclaimed movies series and saved the data in a csv file.
The website is imdb.com for web series; there's a section of quotes on the website for that particular show. For this particular project, I used the quotes section of the Game of Thrones to extract data.

You just have to edit the link section, and you can get the quotes for your favourite show from the imdb.com
